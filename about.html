                    Nice to meet you! I'm Lacey, currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin
                    following my goals to become a Web Developer. Before this journey, I owned a coffee shop outside
                    of Austin. It was tough, tiring and frustrating. More importantly, it was rewarding.
                    I learned to solve problems, often on the fly. I drank awesome coffee (definitely a perk!) and I met
                    people on all
                    walks of life, which taught me the value in human connection. I experienced the importance of
                    communication, persistence and clarity.
                    I learned that you can start something new and be pretty bad at it but every day you'll get better
                    if you commit the time to it. <br /><br />

                    When I'm not working on code or design, I'm typically cooking or outside with my son and dog.
                    I love reading, music, photography and making lists! I am an INFJ actively trying to understand
                    the ways of extroverts.
