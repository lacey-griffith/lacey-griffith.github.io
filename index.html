            Nice to meet you! I'm Lacey, currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin
            following my goals to become a Web Developer. Before this journey, I owned a coffee shop outside
            of Austin. It was tough, tiring and frustrating. More importantly, it was rewarding.
            I learned to solve problems, often on the fly. I drank awesome coffee (definitely a perk!) and I met people on all
            walks of life, which taught me the value in human connection. I experienced the importance of communication, persistence and clarity. 
            I learned that you can start something new and be pretty bad at it but every day you'll get better
            if you commit the time to it. <br/><br/>

            When I'm not working on code or design, I'm typically cooking or outside with my son and dog.
            I love reading, music, photography and making lists! I am an INFJ actively trying to understand
            the ways of extroverts.

                <p> This project was created during Coding Bootcamp. Through this page I had the oppurtunity to
                    learn hands on and gained experience with HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub.
