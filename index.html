            Nice to meet you! I'm Lacey, currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin
            following my goals to become a Web Developer. Before this journey, I owned a coffee shop outside
            of Austin. It was tough, tiring and frustrating. More importantly, it was rewarding.
            I learned to solve problems, often on the fly. I drank awesome coffee (definitely a perk!) and I met people on all
            walks of life, which taught me the value in human connection. I experienced the importance of communication, persistence and clarity. 
            I learned that you can start something new and be pretty bad at it but every day you'll get better
            if you commit the time to it. <br/><br/>

            When I'm not working on code or design, I'm typically cooking or outside with my son and dog.
            I love reading, music, photography and making lists! I am an INFJ actively trying to understand
            the ways of extroverts.

                <p> Run Buddy was created during Coding Bootcamp. Through this project I 
                    gained experience with HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub to create a landing page for
                    a company needing to increase user sign-ups and interaction.

                <h3 class="project-title">Password Generator</h3>
                <p>
                    Password Generator was an introduction to JavaScript. The capabilities of the language became clearer as I progressed. I was assigned to write the Javascript to generate a randomized 
                    password based off user selected criteria. I used resources such as MDN and W3Schools when I ran into a problem I wasn't familiar on how to solve.

                <p>
                    Task Manager introduced how to use localStorage and creating DOM elements dynamically. I learned to use
                    the console for debugging, testing my code and for finding element values in the browser.
